# Found Elasticsearch

Elasticsearch is an open source, distributed, RESTful search engine, usable by any language that speaks JSON and HTTP. Found Elasticsearch provides you with an entire Elasticsearch-cluster. Whether it is small, big, or small wanting to become big. Memory is reserved â€“ giving you predictable performance, and no arbitrary limitations on how many indexes or documents you'll throw at it.
## Adding or removing the Found Add-on
Found Elasticseach can be added by executing the command addon.add:

~~~
$ cctrlapp APP_NAME/DEP_NAME addon.add foundelasticsearch.free
~~~
When added, Found automatically creates a new account and login configuration including access token. You can access Found for your deployment within the [web console](https://console.cloudcontrolled.com) (go to the specific deployment, choose "Add-Ons" tab and click Found Elasticsearch login).
## Removing the Found Add-on
Similarily, an Add-on can also be removed from the deployment easily:

~~~
$ cctrlapp APP_NAME/DEP_NAME addon.remove foundelasticsearch.free

# Add-on Credentials

## Internal access credentials

It's recommended to the read database credentials from the creds.json file. The location of the file is available in the `CRED_FILE` environment variable. Reading the credentials from the creds.json file ensures your app is always using the correct credentials. For detailed instructions on how to use the creds.json file please refer to the section about [Add-on Credentials](https://www.cloudcontrol.com/dev-center/Platform%20Documentation#add-ons) in the general documentation.
