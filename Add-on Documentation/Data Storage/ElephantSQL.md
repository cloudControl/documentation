# ElephantSQL: PostgreSQL as a Service

The most advanced open-source database, hosted in the cloud.

As a full-featured, open-source relational DBMS (RDBMS), PostgreSQL boasts many characteristics designed to support high-transaction, mission-critical applications.

### Internal Access

It's recommended to the read database credentials from the creds.json file. The location of the file is available in the `CRED_FILE` environment variable. Reading the credentials from the creds.json file ensures your app is always using the correct credentials. For detailed instructions on how to use the creds.json file please refer to the section about [Add-on Credentials](https://www.cloudcontrol.com/dev-center/Platform%20Documentation#add-ons) in the general documentation.
