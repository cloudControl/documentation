Reading the credentials from the creds.json file ensures your app is always using the correct credentials. For detailed instructions on how to use the creds.json file please refer to the section about [Add-on Credentials](https://www.cloudcontrol.com/dev-center/platform-documentation#add-on-credentials) in the general documentation.

The JSON file has the following structure:

~~~
{
   "IRON_MQ":{
      "IRON_MQ_TOKEN":"13371234ASDFasdffdsaqwetrt12334",
      "IRON_MQ_PROJECT_ID":"123345678899900asdf1233"
