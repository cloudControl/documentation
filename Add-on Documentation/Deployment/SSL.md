# SSL Add-on

SSL encryption is available for improved security when transmitting passwords and other sensitive data. As part of the provided `.cloudcontrolled.com` subdomain all deployments have access to piggyback SSL using a `*.cloudconrolled.com` wildcard certificate. To use this, simply point your browser to `https://APP_NAME.cloudcontrolled.com` for the default deployment or to `https://DEP_NAME-APP_NAME.cloudcontrolled.com` for non-default deployments (please note the dash between DEP_NAME and APP_NAME). SSL support for custom domains is available through the SSL add-on.

## Custom Domain Certificates

To enable SSL support for custom domains like `www.example.com` or `secure.example.com` you need the SSL add-on. Root or naked domains like `example.com` are not supported.

Please follow these three simple steps to add SSL support to your deployment.

 1. Acquire a signed certificate from your certificate authority of trust.
 2. Ensure the key is not protected by a passphrase.
 3. Add the SSL addon providing the certificate, the private key and certificate-chain files.
 
Note: Please allow up to one hour for DNS changes to propagate before they go into effect.

### Adding the SSL addon

To add the SSL addon simply provide the paths to the files provided by the certificate authority using the respective parameters of the addon.add command.

 ~~~
 $ cctrlapp APP_NAME/DEP_NAME addon.add ssl.host --cert path/to/CERT_FILE --key path/to/KEY_FILE --chain path/to/CHAIN_FILE
 ~~~

In order to check the status of the addon you can do the following.

 ~~~
 $ cctrlapp APP_NAME/DEP_NAME addon ssl.host
 ~~~

When the SSL certificate is expired, you can update it by removing the addon and re-adding it providing the updated certificate. The SSL service is provided for 23 minutes after removing the addon so that it can be updated in the meantime without interrupting the service. To achieve that you have to run the following commands.

 ~~~
 $ cctrlapp APP_NAME/DEP_NAME addon.remove ssl.host
 $ cctrlapp APP_NAME/DEP_NAME addon.add ssl.host --cert path/to/NEW_CERT_FILE --key path/to/KEY_FILE --chain path/to/CHAIN_FILE
 ~~~

 Note: You need provide the original key and chain again when updating the addon even if those are not changed.

## HTTPS Redirects

HTTPS termination is done at the routing tier. Requests are then routed via HTTP to one of your app's clones. To determine if a request was made via HTTPS originally the routing tier sets the `X-FORWARDED-PROTO` header to `https`. The header is only set for requests that arrived via HTTPS at the routing tier. This allows you to redirect accordingly.

### PHP Example

For PHP you can either redirect via Apache's mod_rewrite using a `.htaccess` file or directly in your PHP code.

#### .htaccess
~~~
<IfModule mod_rewrite.c> 
    RewriteEngine On
    
    RewriteCond %{HTTP:X-FORWARDED-PROTO} !=https [NC]
    RewriteRule ^.*$ https://%{HTTP_HOST}
</IfModule>
~~~

#### PHP
~~~php
<?php

    if (!isset($_SERVER['HTTP_X_FORWARDED_PROTO']) && 
        $_SERVER['HTTP_X_FORWARDED_PROTO'] != 'https') {
        
        header(
            'Location: https://' . 
            $_SERVER['HTTP_HOST'] . 
            $_SERVER['REQUEST_URI']
        );
    
    }

?>
~~~
