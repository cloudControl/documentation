# Deploying a Pyramid application
[Pyramid] prides itself of being a "small, fast, down-to-earth, open-source Python web application development framework." And it is as fast and down-to-earth to make Pyramid work on cloudControl! 

Within minutes, you are going to deploy a simple "Hello World!" Pyramid application on [cloudControl]. 

(To learn more about supported features, please consult our documentation on [Python buildpack].)

## Prerequisites
+ A [Git client]. Command-line or GUI, it's up to you!
+ A [cloudControl] user account.
+ Installed [cloudControl-command-line-client]

## Cloning a simple application
We begin by cloning the python-pyramid-example-app folder:

~~~bash
$ git clone git://github.com/annatraussnig/python-pyramid-example-app.git
$ cd python-pyramid-example-app
~~~

In addition to the original source code of the app, `app.py`, you can see there are two more interesting files in the folder:
+ requirements.txt
+ Procfile

Those files provide information on dependency requirements and process type, essential to cloudControl. Once you've got this part sorted, you are practically done!


### Dependency declaration with Pip
`requirements.txt` lists our dependency requirements. The file should always be saved in the project's root directory.
In our case, this Pyramid app is simple enough to have only one requirement: Pyramid!

~~~pip
Pyramid==1.3
~~~

It is strongly advised you specify the versions of your dependencies. This way, you will get reproducable builds and prevent unexpected errors caused by version changes.


### Process type definitions
cloudControl uses a [Procfile] to know how to start your processes.
Just create a file called `Procfile` at the top level of your repository, with the following content:

~~~
web: python server.py
~~~

The web process type specifies the command that will be executed when the app is deployed.

## Pushing and deploying your app
Almost there! Now choose a unique name (here: APP_NAME) for your application and create it on the cloudControl platform:

~~~bash
$ cctrlapp APP_NAME create python
~~~

Push your code to the application's repository, which creates a deployment image:

~~~bash
$ cctrlapp APP_NAME/default push

    Delta compression using up to 2 threads.
    Compressing objects: 100% (10/10), done.
    Writing objects: 100% (14/14), 1.45 KiB, done.

~~~

Now deploy and watch:

~~~bash
$ cctrlapp APP_NAME/default deploy 
~~~

##Finishing up
And... that's it, really! You should now be able to reach your application at: `http://APP_NAME.cloudcontrolled.com`.
