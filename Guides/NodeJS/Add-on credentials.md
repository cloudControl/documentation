# Getting the add-on credentials 

## Introduction
Each deployment gets different credentials for each Add-on. Providers can change these credentials at any time, so they shouldn't be hard-coded in the source code. If the credentials are not in the source code, they also won't appear in the version control and cause potential security issues.

There are two ways to get the Add-on credentials in a Node.js app.

## Reading the credentials from environment variables 
By default, each Add-on exposes its credentials in the environment. You can look up the individual environment variable names in the respective Add-on documentation. To read them, simply use ***process.env.ENVIRONMENT_VARIABLE_NAME* **in your code. Some examples for database Add-ons can be seen in the last section.

In case you don't want to expose these credentials in the environment, you can disable them by executing:

~~~
$ cctrlapp APP_NAME/DEP_NAME addon.add config.free --SET_ENV_VARS 0
~~~

The Add-on credentials can still be read from the credentials file, as explained in the next section. Note that there are some other interesting environment variables available in your deployment containers, such as the path to the credential file.

## Examples 
cloudControl offers a number of data storage solutions via the Add-on Marketplace. Below is an example on how to access credentials for MySQL. 

###MySQL
To add a MySQL database, use the MySQL Dedicated Add-on or MySQL Shared Add-on.
Here's a Node.js snippet that reads the database settings from the credentials file -

~~~
var fs, configurationFile;
 
configurationFile = process.env.CRED_FILE; 
fs = require('fs');
 
var configuration = JSON.parse(
    fs.readFileSync(configurationFile)
);

var database = configuration.MYSQLD.MYSQLD_DATABASE;
var host = configuration.MYSQLD.MYSQLD_host;
var port = configuration.MYSQLD.MYSQLD_port;
var username = configuration.MYSQLD.MYSQLD_username;
var password = configuration.MYSQLD.MYSQLD_password; 
~~~

The example used the MySQLd Add-on. Variable names for MySQLs differ. Remember, you can always refer to the addon.creds command to see the actual variable names and values.

Similarly, for other databases such as Postgres, credentials can be accessed from the credentials file.
