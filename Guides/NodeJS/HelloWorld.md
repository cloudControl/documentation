# Deploying a Node.js Application
[Node.js] is a platform built on Chrome's JavaScript runtime for building fast
and scalable network applications. Its event-driven, non-blocking I/O model
makes it a lightweight and efficient framework for building data-intensive
real-time cloud apps.

This tutorial demonstrates how to build and deploy a simple Hello World Node.js
application on [dotCloud]. Check out the [Node.js buildpack] for supported
features.

## The Node.js App Explained

### Get the App
First, clone the Node.js App from our repository on Github:

~~~bash
$ git clone https://github.com/cloudControl/nodejs-express-example-app.git
$ cd nodejs-express-example-app
~~~

Now you have a small, but fully functional Node.js application.

### Dependency Tracking
The Node.js buildpack tracks dependencies using [npm]. The dependency
requirements are defined in a `package.json` file which needs to be located in
the root of your repository. For the Hello World application, the only
requirement is Express. The `package.json` you cloned as part of the example
app looks like this:

~~~json
{
  "name": "nodejs-express-example-app",
  "version": "0.0.1",
  "dependencies": {
    "express": "4.10.2",
    "ejs": "1.0.0"
  },
  "engines": {
    "node": "0.10.13",
    "npm": "1.3.2"
  }
}
~~~

You should always specify the versions of your dependencies if you want your
builds to be reproducible and to prevent unexpected errors caused by version
changes.

### Process Type Definition
A [Procfile] is required to start processes on the dotCloud platform.
There must be a file called `Procfile` at the root of your repository. In the
example code you already cloned it looks like this:

~~~
web: node web.js
~~~

Left from the colon, we specified the **required** process type called `web`
followed by the command that starts the app.

## Pushing and Deploying your App
Choose a unique name to replace the `APP_NAME` placeholder for your application
and create it on the dotCloud platform:

~~~bash
$ cctrlapp APP_NAME create nodejs
~~~

Push your code to the application's repository, which triggers the deployment
image build process:

~~~bash
$ cctrlapp APP_NAME push

To ssh://APP_NAME@cloudcontrolled.com/repository.git
 * [new branch]      master -> master
~~~

Last but not least, deploy the latest version of the app with the cctrlapp deploy command:

~~~bash
$ cctrlapp APP_NAME deploy
~~~

Congratulations, you can now see your Node.js app running at
`http[s]://APP_NAME.cloudcontrolled.com`.
