# Deploying a Node.js Application

## Introduction
[Node.js] is a platform built on Chrome's JavaScript runtime for building fast and scalable network applications. Its event-driven, non-blocking I/O model makes it a lightweight and efficient framework for building data-intensive real-time cloud apps.

In this tutorial, we're going to show you how to build and deploy a simple Hello World Node.js application on [cloudControl]. Check out the [Node.js buildpack] for supported features.

## Prerequisites
Before we dive into the details of building the Hello World app, here are a few prerequisites that are needed:  

 - Basic Node.js knowledge, including an installed version of Node.js and [npm].
 - Your application will use npm to manage dependencies.
 - A cloudControl user account. If you don’t have one yet, [sign up here] for free.

## Building a Hello World App
To start building the Hello World app, you first need to get access to the Node.js code for the app in Github.

Make a clone of the Node.js app from the repository using:

~~~bash
$ git clone git://github.com/cloudControl/node-js-sample
$ cd node-js-sample
~~~

Now you have a small, but fully functional Node.js application.

### Declaring Dependencies using NPM
The next step is to declare app dependencies. Node.js tracks dependencies using npm. The dependency requirements must be specified in a `package.json`-file in your project's root directory.  For the Hello World application, the only requirement is Express. This is shown in the json file below:

~~~json
{
  "name": "node-js-sample",
  "version": "0.0.1",
  "dependencies": {
    "express": "~3.3.4"
  },
  "engines": {
    "node": "0.10.13",
    "npm": "1.3.2"
  }
}
~~~

You should always specify the versions of your dependencies if you want your builds to be reproducible and to prevent unexpected errors caused by version changes.

### Starting Processes in cloudControl
A [Procfile] is required to start processes on the cloudControl platform. There must be a file called `Procfile` at the top level of your repository.

In the case of the Node.js app, it is important to invoke the node process as shown below. Note that the process is of type web, which means it is a web app.

~~~
web: node web.js
~~~

## Pushing and Deploying your App
Before you deploy your app, you have to give it a unique name (from now on called `APP_NAME`) for your application and create it on the cloudControl platform:

~~~bash
$ cctrlapp APP_NAME create nodejs
~~~

Push your code to the application's repository, which triggers the deployment image build process:

~~~bash
$ cctrlapp APP_NAME/default push

To ssh://APP_NAME@cloudcontrolled.com/repository.git
 * [new branch]      master -> master
~~~

Last but not least, deploy the latest version of the app with the cctrlapp deploy command:

~~~bash
$ cctrlapp APP_NAME/default deploy
~~~

Congratulations, you can now see your Node.js app running at
