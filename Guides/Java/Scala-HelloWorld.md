# Deploying a Scala application

In this tutorial we're going to show you how to deploy a Scala application on [dotCloud]. You can find the [source code on Github](https://github.com/cloudControl/scalatra-example-app) and check out the [Scala buildpack] for supported features.

## The Scala Application Explained
### Get the App
First, clone the Scala application from our repository on Github:

~~~bash
$ git clone https://github.com/cloudControl/scalatra-example-app.git
$ cd scalatra-example-app
~~~

Now you have a small, but fully functional Scala application.

### Dependency Tracking
Dependencies in Scala applications are resolved using [sbt]. The dependency requirements are defined in the `build.sbt` file which needs to be located in the root of your repository. The one you cloned as part of the example app looks like this:

~~~scala
import com.typesafe.sbt.SbtStartScript

seq(SbtStartScript.startScriptForClassesSettings: _*)

organization := "org.soichiro"

name := "scalatra"

version := "0.1.0-SNAPSHOT"

scalaVersion := "2.9.1"

seq(webSettings :_*)

libraryDependencies ++= Seq(
  "org.scalatra" %% "scalatra" % "2.0.4",
  "org.scalatra" %% "scalatra-scalate" % "2.0.4",
  "org.scalatra" %% "scalatra-specs2" % "2.0.4" % "test",
  "ch.qos.logback" % "logback-classic" % "1.0.0" % "runtime",
  "org.eclipse.jetty" % "jetty-webapp" % "7.6.0.v20120127" % "container",
  "org.eclipse.jetty" % "jetty-webapp" % "7.6.0.v20120127" % "compile",
  "javax.servlet" % "servlet-api" % "2.5" % "provided"
)

~~~

### Process Type Definition
dotCloud uses a [Procfile] to know how to start your processes.

The example code already includes the `Procfile` at the top level of your repository. It looks like this:

~~~
web: target/start
~~~

The `web` process type is required and specifies the command that will be executed when the app is deployed.

## Pushing and Deploying your App
Choose a unique name to replace the `APP_NAME` placeholder for your application and create it on the dotCloud platform: 

~~~bash
$ dcapp APP_NAME create java
~~~

Push your code to the application's repository, which triggers the deployment image build process:

~~~bash
$ dcapp APP_NAME/default push
[...]

-----> Receiving push
-----> Installing OpenJDK 1.7...done
-----> Downloading SBT...done
-----> Running: sbt compile stage
        [...]
-----> Building image
-----> Uploading image (80M)

To ssh://APP_NAME@dotcloudapp.com/repository.git
 * [new branch]      master -> master
~~~

Last but not least, deploy the latest version of the app with the dcapp deploy command:

~~~bash
$ dcapp APP_NAME/default deploy
~~~

Congratulations, you can now see your Scala application running at `http[s]://APP_NAME.dotcloudapp.com`.
