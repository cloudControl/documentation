# Run command examples for ruby

Run command (or SSH session) is really useful for the ruby programmers.
Here are some examples how it can be used for everyday ruby tasks such as
running the migrations or using the rails console.

To migrate the database:
~~~
$ ctrlapp APP_NAME/DEPLOYMENT run "rake db:migrate"
~~~

To run the rails console:
~~~
$ cctrlapp APP_NAME/DEPLOYMENT run "rails c"
~~~

Here is a full example in which multiple commands are run in bash:
~~~
$ cctrlapp APP_NAME/DEPLOYMENT run bash

The same could be accomplished if all the individual commands were chained:
~~~
$ cctrlapp APP_NAME/DEPLOYMENT run "rails g scaffold Post title:string content:text && rake db:migrate && rails c"
~~~

The previous example is quite artificial and it's usefulness in the real world is questionable.
The changes to the database are retained, but all the generated files are lost.
Nevertheless it demonstrates more complex usage of the run command and gives a bit of insight in it's power.
